          <h3>High School</h3>
          <p>I went to Wharton High School, where I took a bunch of arts and science classes, ultimately graduating with a 3.96 GPA, fifth in a class of 500+. The details involve a lot of AP/Dual Enrollment classes that honestly did not end up very useful or practical.</p>
          <h3>Early College</h3>
          <p>I applied to the University of Florida as a biomed major because I had a weird fixation on infectious diseases. Once there, I realized, "wow I dont really like lab work or research" so I switched right into Finance.</p>
          <p>Before the GameStop debacle, I swing traded stocks on avidly in high school. I sucked at it, so naturally I became a Finance major. Not because I wanted to get better at trading, but because Wall Street is where gambling addicts actually make money with stocks. Jokes aside, investment banking caught my eye.</p>
          <h3>First (real) Internship</h3>
          <p>I say "real" not to diss my short summer accounting job that I got by harrassing my dad's boss, but because all I <em>really</em> did there was file paper copies of invoices.</p>
          <p>Anyways, during my freshman summer I got an offer to work at RBC Capital Markets in NYC on the Sales and Trading floor. Why not "real" investment banking? Because I value my sleep and free time. S&T seemed perfect to me- all the glory (and some of the pay) of being a "Wall Street banker" without hating my life.</p>
          <p>Well, I hated my life. Sales and Trading is great for a lot of people, and RBC is a wonderful company that has my sincere respect, but the job got stale for me real fast. The thought of waking up and selling the same financial product to the same customers every day for the rest of time was... demotivating. So I rejected the return offer.</p>
          <h3>Consulting</h3>
          <p>I became interested in consulting almost by accident. Being a cash-strapped student, I applied to a lot of development programs just for their stipends, including Bain's Freshman Leadership Accelerator. I didn't have any real interest at that time, but the zoom meetings were surprisingly fun and I got an Uber Eats voucher on top of the stipend so I've always had good feelings towards Bain.</p>
          <p>It wasn't until my friend Manuel Paz started actually explaining what a consultant does that I realized how fitting it was for me. Dynamic projects, group mobility, decent hours, and lots of money- it all sounded perfect. Luckily, I wasnt too late to apply for Bain's BEL program by the time I decided to pursue consulting.</p>
          <p>I did my BEL program in the Denver office, where I met some of the most intelligent, kind, and supportive coworkers and leadership. By the end of the week, I was sold on Consulting, and not just because of the free food this time.</p>
          <p>Im now looking forward to interning at Bain's Atlanta office this summer!</p>

          <h3>Magic: The Gathering</h3>
          <p>I am an avid collecter and player of the popular trading card game Magic: the Gathering. I started playing in college during the Zendikar Rising set (late 2020). My university has a thriving MTG club, and I joined out of despiration for friends (since it was the only club that met in person during the pandemic).</p>
          <p>It was the worst financial decision I ever made. But I found some amazing friends!</p>
          <p>The club runs Bo3 paper standard tournaments, as well as the occasional proxy-legal modern, pioneer, and eternal formats.</p>
          <p>I mostly play commander now, and I have a fully built Edgar Markov mardu vampires deck, and a WIP Hinata, Dawn Crowned jeskai spell slinger. See my decklists Here. See my deckbox for trades here.</p>
          <p>Looking for Bulk? I am a total bulkrat and I keep my bulk from Innistrad: Midnight Hunt(2021) up till now in pristine condition and organization. If you're looking for anything, I probably have it.</p>
